The choreography is perfect, the sauteed onions first and then the meat on top, chop, lift, chop...it is always the exact same sandwich. The loaf of bread is warm and cut exactly in half, by the dexterous and quiet genious. They only take cash, and your drink choices are either a soft drink or a beer.

You just pick it by yourself and then it served to your table on a hot platter.\nThe platter made of two part- one is still cooking the meat (some meet takes longer to be ready) and the other part just warms it up, and you can always switch your dish from one part to another.\nOf course it served with excellent vegetables, salads and many other good stuff, depends what you like.\nThere is also a wine you can have in an unlimited karafe. What can be better than good meat with some red wine!?\nThe ambiance of the place is very relaxed and cool! \nIt's always a pleasure to visit.\nIf you don't like to eat late at night and have a chance- go there before 7pm for business lunch which gives you 40% off all the meats.
